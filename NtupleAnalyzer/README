In this file you will find instructions how to build and run analysis framework.

1. Adjust orablocks.cfg: choose orange variables to be read from your ntuple (common ntuple also?)
1a. adjust these files (actually links to sources in src/)
	SetBinning.cxx  (choose binning - the whole analysis chain is repeated for each bin)
	DeclareHistograms.cxx	(declare output histograms, the same set for each bin but filling is separate of course)
	Loop.cxx (put here your analysis code)

2. To build simply type:
	make
This will update BaseClass.h according to selected orablocks.cfg using create-BaseClass.py
and afterwards compile the whole analysis framework.
3. Launch the executable:

./analysis

notes:
1. be careful not to put any newlines in config/declarehisto.cfg


-------------------------
room for improvement:
1. Minimize changing of source code, use steering files instead.
