30 November 2009.
* Significantly changed the analysis framework. From now on detailed description of changes.
* Each class is now compiled separately.
* Ntupleanalyzer is now derived from BaseClass, which is created by python script create-BaseClass.py

05 December
* added 'mirroring' stuff; more details in code itself and log.txt

06 December
* added _all and _svtx jet variables, see log.txt

07 December
* implemented filling of inclusive/non-inclusive histos in one go - added more histograms
(drawback: code looks more messy; some histos are declared twice in config file;
 advantage: no need to launch code twice)
 
12 December
* removed some of the TGlobalBin methods that should better belong to TMiniNtupleAnalyzer
* Assigned 'phase' variable to each TBin in TGlobalBin so that one can choose which variables to check now
--> changed TGlobalBin::AddBin(), TGlobalBin::CheckGlobalBin()


15-16 February 2010
* changed python class creator - added AddTreeBranches method so that class can be used for minintuple
  creation (sime kind of zacon replacement)
* created TMiniNtupleCreator class, automatized submission
