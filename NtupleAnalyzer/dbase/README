This is directory with 'database' files, i.e. various data that are needed for programs
but are not supposed not be changed or change very rarely

./orablocks:
orange block definitions.
Format:
File name=Name of the block (First letter big, other small)
File content:
<type>  <name>  [<array dimensions>]

put a newline after the last variable!
Room for improvement: make these control cards mechanism more robust, so that there's no
dependence on newlines etc.
