// |                in ZEUS inner trackers                         |
// |        evaluated using VMCU utility and mapped                |

// |      Efficiency and fraction of interactions are              |
// |      normalized to a number of MC tracks which                |
// |      are able to cross SL=3, i.e. efficiency takes            |
