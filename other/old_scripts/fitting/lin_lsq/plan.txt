Lecture plan for lecture linear least square method:

* Reminder least square method
  y = f(t,x)  t continuous parameter, x = vector o 
  chisquare = Sum (y - f(t,x)^2/sigma_y^2
  min -> solution for x

* Linear fit problems, f(t,x) = A x + b 
  examples: constant, straight line,
  parabola, polynom, exponential with normalisation factor

* Most simple problem, constant fit:
  x = a
  e.g. averaging of different measurements
   
* constant fit: 
  'stupid' example only one measurement value \hat{a} with
  error \sigma_a
  Min. chisquare from d\chi2/da = 0
  at a = a0
= 0 for a = \hat{a}
  probability for true value (inverse probability)
  prob = e^{-chi2/2) =  e^{- (a-\hat{a})^2/sigma_a}     
  Important relations:
  - Min chisquare: dchi2/da = 0
  what about the error? obviously the error is sigma_a
  This can be also retrieved from
  - sigma_a =   (d2chi2/da2|min}^{-1/2}
  - for a+- sigma_a --> chi2 --> 0 + 1 

* generalised for all cases:
  \hat{x} = estimator for parameters x
  --> chi2(x) = chi2(\hat{x}) + d2chi2/dx*(x-xhat) + 2. Ordnung
  --> der Fehler ist  sigma_a =   (d2chi2/da2|min}^{-1/2}
  chi^2= chi^2min +1 

* 2 measurements of a constant:
  - Add parabolas graphically MINI-EXERCISE
  - Analytical solution 
  - Result = weighted average
  - chisquare_min = (a2-a1)^2/(sigma_1^2+sigma^2)
    --> this should just follow again e^{-chi2/2) gauss
        distribution 
  - fitprobability for 1 degree of freedom

*  Probability for 2 measurements chisquare for know
   true value --> chi2 for 2 degrees of freedom
   generalisation for n degrees of freedom
   
* n measurements of a constant
  formulas  
  Mini exercises with calculating probabilities
  outlier rejection


* Straight line fit:
