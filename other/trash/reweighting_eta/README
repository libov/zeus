Here are some script(s) to determine eta reweighting, for charm at the moment.
The reweighting function is derived from scaling factors, (that is a measure
how MC underestimates data). Note, that scaling factors have to be divided
by the global scaling factor.

plots in scaling_factors_2.29.8 were obtained by plot_results as usual but
with slight modification - that is plotting only scaling factors for 2.29.8 and nothing
else. In order to make sure they are fine - they were compared to
PLOTS_PATH/25_15October2011/02_scaling_factors_charm_2.29.8_vs_2.29.1 
and were found to agree reasonably.

fit.cxx - takes a histo in etajet.root (charm), and makes a fit to it

Minimizer is Linear
Chi2                      =     3.66074
NDf                       =     8
p0                        =     1.16371         +/-     0.0223886
p1                        =     0.135495        +/-     0.0279819
p2                        =     0.0888558       +/-     0.0334203

y = p0 + p1 * x + p2 * x*x

note, that fit parameters have to be divided by a global scaling factor 
(k_c=1.2419 from 
results.full.forCHARM2.29.8.0405e06e07p.v02.true05e06e0607p.xml),
which gives

p0 = 0.93704002 = 0.937
p1 = 0.10910299 = 0.109
p2 = 0.071548273= 0.0715


NOTE!!! realized there should be one more normalizing coefficient,
namely to ensure that the total true cross section is not changed
after reweighting;
2.29.10 (before): <sigma_c_true>14015.3</sigma_c_true>
2.29.11 (before): <sigma_c_true>14510.5</sigma_c_true>

hence a weight factor has to be applied: 14015.3 / 14510.5 = 0.9659
that means

p0 = 0.93704002 * 0.9659 = 0.9051
p1 = 0.10910299 * 0.9659 = 0.105383
p2 = 0.071548273 * 0.9659= 0.069108

Repeating exactly the same if adding resolved samples

hence 
p0                        =     1.01984 / 1.08873 = 9.36724440403038483e-01 = 0.9367
p1                        =     0.152761 / 1.08873 = 1.40311188265226455e-01 = 0.1403
p2                        =     0.0735529 / 1.08873 = 6.75584396498672829e-02 =  0.067558
NOTE: here we try don't apply other global factors to preserve total true cross-section,
seems this is unnecessary, but to be checked of course!

starting 2.29.19 to see the effect of such a reweighing

-----------------------------------------------------
systematic variation of the reweighting
max up:		fcn_up -> SetParameters(1.16371, 0.135495, 0.15);
max down:	fcn_down -> SetParameters(1.16371, 0.135495, 0.05);
change the parameter 3 with 0.02 step
0.05, 0.07, 0.0888558, 0.11, 0.13, 0.15
 (each coefficient to be normalized by kc=1.2419, i.e. nominally:)
p0 = 0.93704002 = 0.937
p1 = 0.10910299 = 0.109
p2 = 0.071548273= 0.0715
(i.e. not normalizing to the true cross section which is redundant! - to be checked)
(NOTE: this is with the simultaneous reweighting of et, hence the total normalization
factor is a bit different, but again, that should not matter)
