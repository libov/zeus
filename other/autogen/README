*** Instructions on how to run AUTOGEN

1. Prepare a conig file (or a set of config files) analogously to config.<suffix>.cfg in this folder
2. Edit script called submit-steer.sh, namely change variable called CONFIGSET to set of config files you want to process
3. login to zarah
4. ./submit-steer.sh > logfile


*** some old remarks
--> config AE was splitted in 0304p and others (0304p was submitted while others not - wrong incoming lepton)

--> if running manually, don't forget to rm heracles.dat (22.01.2010)
